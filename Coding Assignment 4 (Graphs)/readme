Q1a) Input of the format:
        a b c
        x(1) y(1)
        .
        .
        .
        x(b) y(b)

Q1b) Same as Q1a

Q1c) Same as above but without the third variable on the first line

Q2a) Input format:
        a b
        x(1) y(1) z(1)
        .
        .
        .
        x(b) y(b) z(b)

Q2b) Same as Q2a

Q3a) Input format:
        a b c
        x(1) y(1) z(1)
        .
        .
        .
        x(b) y(b) z(b)
    Note that if even one vertex is not reachable from the source vertex,
    program will exit and no output will be printed.

Q3b) Same as Q3a
     Unlike Q3a, if a particular vertex is unreachable, it'll print infinity(INT_MAX)
     as the output for that particular vertex as path length.
