1) Restrict usage of the programs to a small number of elements(Around 100-150 will most likely work 
   as long as the numbers are not too large). The code is reading only 1000 characters at max as input 
   so please keep that in mind while generating the input.
2) To print the tree, ensure that you give an input of the following form:
            4 x
   Where x is any integer. The code is scanning 2 integers before moving on to execute the instruction
   so the x is necessary for it to execute.
3) The procedure to create the red-black tree in Q5 is the same as the other 4 questions
4) For Q1-Q4, keep in mind that the code runs within an infinite loop. Thus, the program must be manually
   terminated to make it stop.
