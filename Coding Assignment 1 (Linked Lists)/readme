Question1
    1) Enter size of linked list at the cursor itself and press Enter
    2) Enter all the values either on the same line with spaces or all on separate lines

Question2
    Same instructions as Question1

Question3
    1) Please limit the operands to (+ - * / % ^) where ^ stands for exponent
    2) Please parenthesize the infix expression properly
    3) Feel free to add spaces to make your expression more readable, the program will assume they are absent
    4) Please restrict the input to a single line

Question4
    1) The program takes input elements one by one, with a choice to continue after each input
    2) Please ensure that the input sets are disjoint, otherwise repeated elements will be printed in the union

Question5
    Same instructions as Question1 (Only difference: Input here is size of set instead of linked list)

Question6
    1) For the insert option, enter position numbers starting from 1, not from 0. Enter data to be inserted
       and the position in the same line with a space in between
    2) Similarly for the delete option, enter position numbers starting from 1
