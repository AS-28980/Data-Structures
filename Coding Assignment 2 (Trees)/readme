Question 1)
    No specific instructions. Maintain a single space between inputs that are on the same row.

Question 2)
    Enter both expressions on one line each, right after the colon. Maintain spaces between numbers and only
    click Enter after you've input the entire string.

Question 3)
    Same as Q2

Question 4)
    Same as Q2. Please input expressions only for a tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children,
    otherwise program might recurse infinitely and give no output. Essentially, while program will handle
    cases where no possible trees can be found, it will fail for cases where multiple trees can be formed.

Question 5)
    Please give inputs very carefully. Also give ASCII values for the operators during input. Avoid giving
    numbers which have the same ASCII value as those of the operators, because program might malfunction for
    some cases. Acceptable operators are (+ -> 43), (- -> 45), (* -> 42), (/ -> 47), (% -> 37) and (^ -> 94).
    Be mindful of division by 0. Multiple occurrences of the same operator has been handled so that will not
    create an issue.

Question 6)
    Same as Q1
